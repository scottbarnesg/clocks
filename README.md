### Stages:
1. A link will be provided to you by the server administrator. Go to this link in a supported web browser.
2. You will be shown a set of cards. This is your hand, which you must memorize. There is a countdown displayed under the cards, which indicates how much time you have until the game starts. When the game starts, you will no longer be able to see your hand.
